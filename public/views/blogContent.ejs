                <!-- ðŸ’¡ This is a humorous piece. We all need to unwind and have a little fun every now and then. Please donâ€™t
            take any of this advice seriously.
            <br>
            <br>

            Maybe you are an experienced developer and have a lot of skills and experience to help teach us how to be a
            good front-end developer.

            <br>
            <br>
             Unfortunately, Iâ€™m an average programmer and I can only share with you how to be the worst front-end
            developer ever.
            <br>
            Haha, I have 15 years of experience in this field. Letâ€™s learn some bad advice together and get fired from
            the company as soon as possible!
            <br>
            1. Please use global variables as much as possible
            You should use global variables as much as possible and teach your colleagues to use this coding style.
            <br>
            <br>

            2. We can`t object to any functionality envisioned by the Product Manager
            We should accept all the requirements planned by the product manager and not put forward our own thoughts
            and objections.
            <br>
            Please do your best to realize the complex, chaotic and cumbersome functions of interaction and gain a sense
            of technical achievement through it, and be a little white rabbit who is not picky about food.
            <br>
            3. Please never write code comments
            Why should we write notes? In order to make your colleagueâ€™s work easier? I refuse!!!
            4. We should reject TypeScript
            We canâ€™t use TypeScript and should reconstruct the items written by TypeScript into JavaScript code, which
            is more conducive to maintenance and expansion.
            <br>
            Last year, our department hired a leader. After he briefly learned about the rich text editor project I was
            maintaining, he told me that the project needed to be refactored. The goal of the refactoring was to abandon
            TypeScript and rewrite it with JavaScript.
            <br>
            After struggling for several days, I made a difficult decision to leave the company.
